   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Note down the deployed URL

5. **Verify Backend**
   - [ ] Visit `https://your-backend-url.vercel.app` - should see "API Working"
   - [ ] Check `/api/jobs` endpoint works
   - [ ] Test a protected endpoint (should require auth)

### ðŸ”— Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Update Clerk Webhook**
   - Go to Clerk Dashboard
   - Navigate to Webhooks
   - Update endpoint URL to: `https://your-backend-url.vercel.app/webhooks`
   - Save and test the webhook

2. **Update Frontend Environment**
   - Go to Vercel frontend project settings
   - Update `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to your backend URL
   - Redeploy frontend

3. **Update Backend CORS**
   - Ensure `CLIENT_URL` in backend matches your frontend URL
   - Redeploy backend if changed

4. **Update MongoDB Whitelist**
   - In MongoDB Atlas, go to Network Access
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow all IPs (required for serverless)
   - Or add specific Vercel IP ranges

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Vercel Rollback**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Find previous working deployment
   - Click "..." menu â†’ "Promote to Production"

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Keep a backup of all `.env` files locally
   - Document all environment variables

3. **Database**
   - MongoDB Atlas has automatic backups
   - Can restore from snapshot if needed

## Common Deployment Issues

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: 
- Check all import paths are correct
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Clear cache and rebuild: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Solution**:
- Vercel: Must prefix client variables with `VITE_`
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check variable names match exactly

### Issue: MongoDB connection timeout
**Solution**:
- Add `0.0.0.0/0` to MongoDB IP whitelist
- Check connection string is correct
- Verify database user has proper permissions

### Issue: Clerk webhook not working
**Solution**:
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check webhook secret matches
- Ensure endpoint is accessible (not behind auth)
- Check webhook events are selected

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**:
- Update `CLIENT_URL` in backend environment
- Check CORS middleware configuration
- Verify URLs don't have trailing slashes mismatch

### Issue: File uploads failing
**Solution**:
- Verify Cloudinary credentials
- Check file size limits
- Ensure multer is configured correctly
- Check network connectivity
